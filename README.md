# BleSdRemote

## Description

Nowadays some high end phones do not support an extra SD card, therefore its users are limited to the internal storage space. If you need more storage, you have to spend more money or use the manufacturer's proprietary cloud solution as an extension.

Is there some way to solve this problem? I hope so! Only some *extra* storage space has to be *attached* to these mobile phones.

This attachment can be problematic, but fortunately [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy) (BLE) is supported by today's major mobile phone operating systems: iOS, Android and Windows Phone, so the idea is to add extra storage space to these mobile phones through BLE.

This project is about to *demonstrate* that this extension is **possible**!
